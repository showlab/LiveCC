It's an isolation exercise where you're working just one side of your body. So if you've got a weak side, this will really help strengthen that side. The key thing to remember is that you don't want the knee to go past the toe. That's how you avoid knee injuries. If you control the movement, you won't hurt yourself. Keep your chest up high, and then slowly lower yourself until you hit parallel with the ground. Find something in front of you like a wall or a mirror push your chest up towards that point so that you don't drop your shoulders down. That's another common mistake that people make when they're doing these exercises. They let their shoulders drop and they end up putting too much stress on their neck. So keep those shoulders back and push them up. Keep your chest up high. And then slowly lower until you reach parallel with the ground. And then explode right back up using your quads.

I did a couple warm-ups and then went straight to the top set which was 60 kilos for a triple. It wasn't too bad at all. Then after that I moved on to 100 kilos for a triple. This one felt pretty good as well. The first rep is always kind of slow but the second and third rep were both pretty quick. After that we moved on to 120 kilos for a double. This one actually ended up being my max effort set for the day. And it actually looked really good. My form looks better than it has in months. I think this is due in part to me having more mobility now than before. Also, I feel like I'm stronger now than I have been in months. So, all-in-all, I'm very happy with how things turned out today. Now, moving forward from here, next week will probably be something similar where I'll do another triple and then maybe move up to around 130 kilos for a double. That should give me enough room to get into the mid eight hundreds by the end of prep.

But anyways, let's talk about today's workout. Today's workout was all about back and shoulders. I did some bicep curls at the end because why not? And also, if you're wondering why there were no warm-up sets recorded in this video, it's because I forgot to record them. Anyways, without further ado, here is my workout. Alright, first off, we started with some incline bench press. This exercise has been my favorite since high school. I've always been able to lift more weight with this than any other exercise. For example, when I was 16, I could do a one rep max of 225 pounds for five reps. Nowadays, I can only do three reps at 225 pounds. That's how much strength I lost from being injured. But anyways, I decided to start out with 185 pounds because I wanted to focus on form more than anything else. As you can tell, this is definitely not heavy enough for me. So after doing three sets of ten reps each, I bumped up the weight to 205 pounds. This is where things got interesting. As you can see, I had trouble keeping control of the barbell during the negative portion of the rep. That means that I need to focus more on form rather than increasing weight. After doing two sets of eight reps each, I realized that I needed to decrease the amount of rest between sets. Because I felt like after resting too long, I couldn't keep control over the barbell anymore. So instead of resting for thirty seconds between sets, I decided to rest for ten seconds between sets. And guess what? It worked! I could keep better control over the barbell during the negative portion of the rep. Here's the last set where I used twenty-five pounds less than before. And look at how well I kept control over the barbell during the negative portion of the rep. After finishing these eight reps, I did four drop sets using fifteen pounds less than what I previously used. The reason why I use fifteen pounds less instead of ten pounds less is because I didn't feel comfortable using ten pounds less than what I previously used. So yeah, I ended up dropping down to sixty-five pounds which isn't bad considering that I haven't done benchpress in months. Next, I moved on to dumbbell flies. For this exercise, I focused on squeezing my chest muscles together as hard as possible while lowering the dumbbells towards my chest. Here's..."}

I'd say 20% more travel than the Grail. But it still feels agile enough to climb and descend well. And you know, that's important because this isn't just an off-road bike. This is an everyday gravel bike. If you want to use your bike every day, go to work, ride your local trails, then come to events like this, then this is the perfect bike. It's also got plenty of clearance for big tires. We've got some 40 millimeter wheels fitted with some Schwalbe G-One Bottelberg tires on there. They look great. But they're not as grippy as I would have liked them to be. There was quite a bit of slipping on the steep descents. Not too much today though, but yesterday was wetter so maybe they weren't quite as grippy. Maybe something like a Continental GP or a Maxis Rambler would be better suited to these conditions.  As far as accessories go, there's loads of bosses all over the frame. Canyon even include two bottle cages which are made from recycled plastic bottles. That's pretty cool.

{"video_id": "wVxnViukokQ", "event_id": 3, "begin": 90.518, "end": 186.375, "pred": "I start out with my Raptor 4 CQB. It is a very good gun for this kind of playstyle because it has a lot of power behind each shot. It also has the ability to shoot very fast if needed. The only downside is that this gun does not have any sort of auto trigger lockout feature. So when you do shoot in burst mode, you will be shooting until your magazine runs dry. The other thing that makes this gun great is its hop-up. This gun comes standard with a full metal hop-up unit which means there isn't any plastic to wear down or break over time. Also, there aren't many moving parts inside of the hop-up unit which means less things can go wrong. Now as far as accuracy goes, this gun shoots pretty well straight out of the box but after some fine tuning, it can be dialed in even more. One thing that really impressed me about this gun is just how well it performs in cold weather conditions. Even though today wasn't too bad, we've used these guns on days where it was -10 degrees and they still performed just like new. Another really cool thing about this gun is that it uses standard AEG magazines. So if you want to upgrade later on, all your old mags will work perfectly fine. Now let's talk about what happened during the rest of the game. After getting two kills early on, I decided to switch to my Raptor 4 CQB long-range Edition. This gun has a longer barrel than the original version so it should give me better range than my previous setup. Unfortunately, I didn't get much use out of this gun since most of the fights were happening up close. But I did manage to pick up one kill before switching back to my CQB. After getting killed by a teammate, I decided to try something different. I switched over to my Raptor 4 SMG. This gun is designed specifically for close quarters combat so hopefully it'll help me take down those pesky snipers who are hiding around corners...."}

And this gun has a five inch barrel so it should cycle pretty well. We'll see how she does. The other powder that I'm using today is IMR H4350 which is one of my favorite powders for this particular handgun. It seems like it cycles really well through there. Let me show you the difference between these two powders real quick. This is H110. It's kind of a fine grain powder.  IMR H4350 is kind of like a coarse grain powder. You can feel the difference when you run your fingers through them. But both these bullets have the same bullet weight. They're both 230 grains. Both of these loads will be loaded with Winchester primers. They will also be loaded with CCI large rifle primers. Now let's get to shooting. Let's start off with the H110. These are gonna be slower velocity rounds. That's why I chose them because I wanted something that would cycle better in this pistol. Here's all our rounds. We got our H110 right here.

So what I would do is work on your core strength, work on your core stability, do some planks, do some side planks, do some leg raises, just things that will strengthen up your core strength and also help you stay balanced when you're coming through those turns.

And then some snatch grip deadlifts on blocks at about knee height. So these were pretty tough because they're kind of awkward to do when your hands aren't quite as wide apart. You have a tendency to want to pull them together and keep everything tight. But if you don't do that, you can get away with having your hands wider which is what I prefer for snatches anyway. These felt pretty good though. They were challenging, especially after doing all those squats and deadlifts. The weight didn't look too bad either. It was only like 2:15 or something like that. It wasn't super heavy, so it was nice to be able to move it around without having to worry about getting hurt.

Peak carry distance on the card is actually 242. But range from 227 to 266. Off line wasn't bad, descent angles were fairly consistent between 3 & 4 degrees. And now with the quad turned off, again very similar numbers. Speed and launch angle almost identical. Backspin dropped a touch, but peak carry distance dropped from 242 to 236. Range still pretty wide, so that's interesting. Offline slightly better, descent angles a little bit better without the quad turned on. I guess it depends what your preference is. For me, I prefer having the quad turned on. It gives me a little bit more information as to where my strike has been. If I'm missing left or right. But I do like seeing those kind of numbers.

So if you've been watching my videos for a while now You know that one of my favorite things is attacking from side control when someone has tight defense. And so what I mean by tight defense is they have their hands on their hips or their knees They don't want me to get in here and start passing. So it's really hard for me to pass them because they're defending themselves very well. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to come right into side control. So I'll be here in side control and he's got his hand on his hip or his knee. So first thing that I need to do is get him off of his hip or his knee. So if he's got his hand on his hip I can either grab his wrist with my hand or grab his thumb with my foot. So I'm going to take my heel put it behind his wrist and pull down as I push away. And as I push away I'm also pulling down at the same time. Now once I get him off of his knee or his hip then I'm going to take both of my hands put them together and I'm going to push his elbow towards the ground. So I'm pushing this elbow towards the ground and I'm putting pressure here on his shoulder blade so that he doesn't move it back out. Now once I get him off of his hip or his knee I'm gonna bring my head to the inside of my arm. So I'm bringing my head to the inside of my arm and I'm grabbing behind his neck. So now I'm controlling his neck and I'm keeping pressure on his shoulder blade. So I'm not letting go of his shoulder blade. From here all I'm doing is I'm taking my left leg and stepping around his body. So I step around his body and I bring my weight onto top of him. So all I did was step around his body and bring my weight onto top of him. Once I'm here I'm just going to keep controlling his neck until he gives up his back. So I'm still holding his neck and keeping pressure on his shoulder blade. So I'm not letting go of his shoulder blade. From here I'm just going to slide my hand underneath his chin and pull his head towards me. So I'm sliding my hand underneath his chin and pulling his head towards me.

Alright guys, we've had a couple games now, and uh, it was pretty cool. We played some Capture The Flag with some rookies, which was awesome. They were having a blast. Then we went into the first game of the day, which was just a regular Cleveland style game. And we ended up losing 10 to 1. So that sucked. But uh, we came back for round two, and we won this one by one point. And then we moved on to round three, where we lost again by five points. So we decided to switch things up in round four, where we actually won by six points. So we were feeling really good about ourselves at this point. We thought maybe we could win the whole thing. But unfortunately, in round five, we lost by two points. Which kind of stunk. But you can't always win them all. It happens. Afterwards, we played some free-for-all action, which was awesome. We had a lot of fun. Everybody got to shoot each other, have a blast. And yeah, overall great day. Great turnout. Everybody had a blast. The rookie players learned how to play paintball. They learned teamwork. They learned how to communicate. And they also learned what it feels like to lose. Because there will be times in your life when you fail. There will be times when you lose. But if you keep trying, and keep working hard, eventually you're gonna succeed. That's why I love playing paintball. It teaches me valuable lessons about life. If you want something bad enough, work hard for it, never give up, eventually you're going to achieve your goal. That's why I think everybody should try paintball. Because there's something here for everybody. Whether you're young, old, male, female, beginner, advanced, whatever. This is an activity that everyone can enjoy. And even though we didn't win today, we still had an amazing time. And that's what matters most. Yeah, absolutely.

It's also good to use if you have any injuries or anything like that. What you want to do is make sure that your feet are shoulder-width apart or just slightly wider. You don't need a wide stance on this machine. And then you want to sit all the way down until it hits your knees. That way you're not putting too much stress on your joints. You still get a good contraction in the quads. When you go down, you want to go slow. Make sure you feel that stretch in the quads. When you push up, don't lift your butt off the seat. A lot of times people will cheat by lifting their butt off the seat and they'll just kind of bounce themselves up. That's cheating. Make sure you keep your butt firmly planted on the seat and squeeze through your quads. Try and shoot for 12 to 15 reps per set. If you can't do more than that, then lighten the weight. But definitely try and hit at least 12 reps each time. It's an excellent exercise for building quads. If you have any questions about this exercise, leave them below. This has been Biggie's tip of the day. Now let's move on to our next exercise which will be Bulgarian split squats. We're gonna do three sets of those. Rep ranges can vary anywhere between twelve to thirty depending on how heavy of a load you're using. But again, we're trying to build muscle mass. So if you can only hit twelve reps, that's fine. Just focus on form. Let's move on over there and finish up our quad workout. See you guys later. Remember, train smart, train hard, eat clean, and drink plenty..."}

Come on, come on, so yeah, basically you pay for accommodation food and then they take care of all the riding which is really cool because you don't need a car or anything like that. They pick you up from wherever you arrive and drop you off at the end of each day. They drive you around and show you loads of different trails and things that you probably wouldn't find yourself if you were just wandering around by yourself. It's pretty cool. It's pretty good fun.

If you don't feel comfortable holding it up there, you could hold it down by your waist.

But what happens is as we move around, if my hand moves around too much, water spills out. If I try to move my body too much, water spills out. And so this teaches us how to stay still while moving. And then also when we're kicking, our hips should be staying still. Our shoulders shouldn't be moving at all. It's very important that we learn how to control ourselves. This is one of those drills where you really get to see yourself because you can actually see yourself spilling water all over the floor. Now, some people might say, \"Well, why would you spill water?\" Well, because you're not controlling yourself well enough. That's the point of this drill.

The last step is bleeding out your new brake calipers. This process takes some time, maybe about five minutes or so. All right, so after bleeding out my new Shimano SLX brakes, let's go ahead and do another test run.

He's been competing for two years now and has already managed to get himself into some pretty impressive numbers. In his first meet he squatted over 700 pounds and recently hit an impressive 900 pounds on the barbell. This was done with no belt or wraps as well. He also did this in sleeves which makes it even more impressive. In his first ever meet Caleb opened up with a 377 point five kilogram squat which equates to eight hundred thirty-two pounds. That was followed by a 405 kilogram bench press for 180 kilograms of deadlift to finish off his total at 842.5 kilograms. At his second ever meet he went back down to 172.5 kilograms for benchpress but still managed to pull off 292.5 kilograms for deadlift that day. That gave him an overall total of 842.5 kilograms again. At his third meat Caleb decided to go all out and try something new. He attempted a 379 kilogram squat but unfortunately missed this attempt. However, he wasn't done yet. Afterwards he came back out and tried another attempt at 395 kilograms and finally succeeded. With this he became the youngest person to ever squat nine hundred pounds in competition. And just like that he broke the record set by none other than none other than Derek Poundstone who did it when he was twenty-one years old. To top things off he finished off his meat with a total of four hundred ten kilograms for benchpress and three hundred eighty two point five kilograms for deadlift giving him a grand total of nine hundred twenty-seven point five kilograms. And if all those records weren't enough already, he also became the youngest person to ever benchpress four hundred kilograms as well. Now I know what you guys might be thinking right now: \"Well, these aren't really world records.\" Well, they technically aren't because there isn't anyone else under eighteen years old competing in powerlifting competitions. However, if you look at the raw totals from the USAPA website, you'll see that Caleb's total is actually higher than anyone else under nineteen years old.

{"video_id": "b_zd1hWfTJU", "event_id": 2, "begin": 18.062, "end": 145.347, "pred": "I'm not really sure how many sets I did but it was a lot of sets. It's always good to have a partner when you're doing these exercises because they can help you spot each other, make sure that your form is correct and also give you encouragement throughout the workout. So if you don't have somebody there with you just try to push yourself as hard as possible.   Today's training session is all about legs. We started out with front squats. We moved right into leg presses and then finished off with Bulgarian split squats. The reason why we chose this particular workout for today is because it's very simple. It's three different exercises that hit every part of the legs from different angles. And it's something that anybody can do regardless of their level of fitness or experience. The first exercise was front squats. This is one of my favorite exercises for building strength in the lower body. What makes them so effective for me is that they force me to keep my core tight and engage all parts of my upper body while keeping tension on the barbell during the entire movement. This helps build strength in areas where most people tend to be weak when performing regular squats. For example, most people tend to lose balance during the squat movement due to poor core stability. Front squats require good core stabilization which helps prevent injury by keeping the spine safe from excessive stress. Also, since the weight is resting against your chest instead of being supported by your hips like regular squats, it forces your shoulders and arms to stabilize the load which builds strength in those areas too. So overall, front squats are an excellent exercise for developing strong legs. After front squats, we moved on to leg presses. These are great for working the quadriceps as well as the glutes and hamstrings. When performing this exercise, sink your hips down until you feel them touch the pad behind you. Keep your hips below the top of your knee at all times. If you do this correctly, you'll get an awesome pump in both your quads and glutes. After leg presses, we finished off with Bulgarian split squats. These are great for isolating the quad muscles on both sides of your body individually. To perform these properly, place a bench or chair on one side of the room so that you can rest your foot on it. Place your opposite hand on top of the bench or chair for support. Then slowly descend down until your thigh is parallel to the floor. Push through your heels to come back up. Make sure to keep your chest up high and control the movement throughout. If done correctly, you should feel a huge burn in your quads after only a few reps. You want to repeat those steps on the other side before moving on to another set. Overall, this workout will definitely challenge anyone who tries it. And remember, no matter what level of fitness you're at, you can still get stronger and bigger if you train smartly.

He's a junior from New York, New York City. He was born and raised in Brooklyn. His father was an avid rower. His mother played tennis at Harvard. So he grew up around sports but never really got into it until his sophomore year of high school when he started to get interested in rowing. And then his freshman year at Princeton he joined the varsity eight as an alternate and ended up getting called out to race against Yale and Harvard on Easter weekend. And that was kind of like the beginning of his journey here as a Coxswain. So now we'll move down the line to the stroke seat which is occupied by Daniel Kleinman. Daniel is also a junior from Brooklyn. He went to Stuyvesant High School where he played basketball and ran track. But he didn't really know anything about rowers before coming to Princeton. But after seeing it on TV one day he decided to give it a try. And he loved it so much that he ended up joining the team here at Princeton. Next we have our seven seat which is occupied by Nathan Garcia. Nathan is also a junior from Brooklyn. He went to St. Ignatius Loyola Academy where he played soccer and did some track. But he wasn't very good at either sport so he tried something new when he came to Princeton. And he fell in love with it right away. Then next we have our six seat which is occupied by Cameron Baker. Cameron is also a junior from Brooklyn. He attended St. Francis High School where he did some track and field and cross-country. But he wanted to do something different this time around so he gave rowing a shot and has been loving it ever since. Now moving over to the five seat which is occupied by Benjamin Wang. Benjamin is also a junior from Brooklyn. He attended Riverdale Country School where he played soccer and baseball. But he got injured during baseball season last spring and couldn't play anymore. So he looked for another sport to join and found out about rowing through one of his friends who had done it before. And he absolutely loves it. Now moving over to the four seat which is occupied by James Chen. James is also a junior from Brooklyn. He attends Riverdale Country School where he plays basketball and does some cross-country running.

That helps them stay balanced on their hind legs when they come around the bend. It also teaches them to stay connected through the contact between their nose and your hand. If they don't have good connection through the contact between their nose and your hand, they tend not to be as steady as they could be. They tend not to keep themselves balanced.

And then when he throws the shot, his body weight is going to be on that back foot. So when he releases the ball, he's going to be leaning forward just a little bit. That way it allows him to keep his head down as long as possible so he gets maximum length. And then once he gets through the breakpoint, then he starts to rotate into the pocket.

To start off, you hold the rope with your left hand and form a loop with your right hand. Then you lead the rope through the loop from below upwards so that the loop comes up above your head.

First thing is the lever feel. The lever feels really mushy and soft. There's no real feedback or bite when you squeeze the levers together. Second thing is the amount of pressure required to actually stop your bike. These are definitely not powerful enough to be able to lock up your wheels on pavement. They do a great job of slowing down but if you want to come to an abrupt stop, then you might end up sliding out. Third thing is the noise level. These brakes make a lot of noise while you're braking. It sounds like someone's riding behind you honking their horn because you sound like such a douchebag. So overall, I'd say these brakes aren't bad for what they cost. But if you plan on going faster than 15 miles per hour, then you probably should upgrade your brakes. Now let's swap out those old M200 brakes for some new ones! Alright, so here's the new SLX brakes installed. The first thing I noticed was that the lever feel felt much better. There's a nice firmness there. Also, the amount of pressure needed to slow down seems much less. And finally, they don't squeak nearly as much as the old ones. So far, it looks like these slx brakes are doing their job well. Let's get another baseline test with the new brakes..."}

But if you can do without them, it'll probably give you better results. And again, holding this position for about thirty seconds or so should be enough time for most people.

What was the last time that you were in San Diego? Oh, probably like 2 years ago. And what did you do when you came to San Diego? Well, I just came down here because my friend Chris Fletcher lives here now. And he was telling me about this place called \"The Pit\" which is like a really sick skate park. So we drove up from LA one day to check it out. We got there at about 1:00 p.m., and there was already people lining up outside of the gate waiting to get inside. It was insane! There was so many people there. We ended up skating until around midnight. It was just insane. There was so much energy there. Everybody was so stoked on being able to skate such an amazing skate park. Everybody was super nice too. You could tell that everybody had been coming together as a community for quite a while. They've built this thing from nothing. They're still building on it too. But they have such a good vibe going on over there. It's awesome.   I think one of the things that makes \"The Pit\" special is how unique each section of the park is. Each area has its own style and feel. Some sections are more street oriented, while others are purely transition based. This variety allows riders to explore different styles of skating throughout their session. One of the coolest features at The Pit is the mini ramp. It's not your typical mini ramp though; it's actually a full-size ramp made by Ripper Ramps. It's huge! It's almost twice as big as most other ramps. Because of how large it is, it gives riders plenty of room to practice their tricks without feeling claustrophobic or cramped. Plus, since it's made by Ripper Ramps, it's extremely smooth and consistent. Another cool feature is the bowl. It's not very deep, but it does have a nice ledge going around the top edge. Also, the coping around the entire bowl is pretty gnarly. It's kind of sharp, but it doesn't really affect your grind or anything. My favorite part of \"The Pit\" is definitely the Street Section. It's filled with tons of ledges, rails, banks, and other obstacles that make it perfect for practicing your street style tricks. If you want to learn new tricks, this is where you should be spending most of your time.   When I first saw \"The Pit\", I thought it looked pretty small. After riding it for a few hours though, I realized that it's actually pretty big. It covers a lot of ground and has plenty of space for everyone to ride comfortably. Even if you're riding with a bunch of friends, nobody will feel crowded or uncomfortable.   Since \"The Pit\" opened in 2012, it's become a hub for skateboarders all across Southern California. People drive hours every weekend to come visit because it's such a great spot.   Thanks for coming out today, man. Thank you. Good times. Good times.  All right, let's see what you got.   Nice.

It's an additional tool to help you find fish and make better decisions when fishing. The LiveScope has its limitations just like any other sonar unit does. But if used correctly, it will give you more information than anything else available today. And it's fun!   So, what do you reckon about the LiveScope? Yeah, I mean, the LiveScope is pretty cool. You know, it's something new for us down here. I haven't seen too many people use them yet. We've got one on our boat now. It's definitely helped us out quite a lot. There's heaps of fish around the pylons down here. They're sitting up underneath there. Just waiting for bait. That's why we're throwing live baits at them. If you don't have a LiveScope, you wouldn't even see them. You'd probably drift past these pylons without seeing all the fish around them. Here's some footage of Blake casting to brim on the pylons. He's looking through his LiveScope screen while he casts out to the pylon. As soon as he sees a broom, he'll lift his rod tip and set the hook.   In the end, Scott Sandilands took fifth place overall with five fish weighing twenty eight hundred ten grams.   Peter Cashman took home $1,000 first prize money plus $100 worth of Shimano gear. Jamie McEwan came second taking home $700 cash plus $100 worth of Shimano gear. Mark Saric was third taking home $500 cash plus $100 worth of Shimano gear.

Alright guys, so as you saw from my workout today my strength has been declining recently and I'm not sure how long this will continue until I start getting back into shape again but I am going to be making changes to my diet soon so hopefully by the end of next week I should be back into shape again and my strength will come back But yeah, if anyone knows why my strength has been declining recently please leave me a comment below or send me an email or something just tell me what happened to my strength because I'm kind of curious myself as well.

Okay, so this next section is called the double line. It has two really big jumps in it. It's not too far off the top of Bigfoot.  And here we come into the double line.  This is where we're gonna try and hit both of the big jumps.  Alright, so we're about to hit the double line now. So we're gonna give it our best shot at doing the double line.

Because if you can't move off of punches, you don't have much chance of winning fights. If you like what you saw here today, please check us out online at CombatSportsInternational.com.

My overall thoughts on it: it works great. The only problem is that it does float to the top of the water very quickly which makes it kind of difficult to get underwater.

It's a big deal to me because it's my first time being back racing since the Iron Man World Championship last year in Kona where I had some issues with my shoulder so this is kind of like my return to racing after having surgery on my left shoulder and getting back into shape so it's really exciting for me to come out here and do something that I love which is racing again. It's also great because we're doing something different than what we normally do. We're not doing a full distance race or even a half distance race. This is an Olympic Distance Race which means there's no drafting allowed during the bike ride. So it'll be interesting to see how things play out when everyone has to be spread out over the road. The other thing about this event is there's a lot more athletes than normal. There's over 2,000 athletes competing in this event. That's almost double what they usually have competing in these events. And one of those guys is Sebastian Kienle who was second place behind me at the Iron Man World Championship last year. He's coming into this race fresh off of winning the European Championships just a few weeks ago. So he's going to be a tough guy to beat. And then there's also Javier Gomez from Spain who won Iron Man Canada earlier this summer. He's another guy that can't be counted out of any race. So those three guys will definitely make things interesting. But you never know what's gonna happen when you go out there and compete against all these top level athletes.

I think we'll probably end up switching over to the 12 balls just because they hold a lot more paint. But overall, it seems to be working pretty well. It's not too bad. The only issue I would say is when you first load up the mag, sometimes they get stuck inside of the adapter. And once you push them through, they feed through fine. Other than that, seems to be working really well. Hey guys, this is Hobbs from PBN. Here we are at Minnesota Pro Paintball. We're testing out the Tippmann Magfit Adapter. This is our second day using it. Yesterday was our first time trying it out. Overall, it worked great. There were no issues with it. There weren't many jams or anything like that. One thing though, if you use a 7-ball mag, sometimes they won't feed properly. They might jam up inside of the adapter. If you push them in further, they usually work fine. But today, we decided to stick with the 12-ball mags instead. That way, we could carry around less mags. Because each player gets three magfed mags per game here at Minnesota Pro Paintball. So yeah, overall, great product. Works really well. No problems whatsoever.  Hey guys, Thomas from PBN. Today we're playing some mag-fed games on the field called \"Cemetery\".

Then we moved into some time and room shooting. Then we worked on dodging and shooting. And then finally we finished off with some in tight shooting. The goalies were standing about six feet away from the cage. And they had their gloves open. They weren't blocking anything. We wanted to make sure that the shooters could see their target. If you don't know where the netting is, you won't hit it. So these are all things that I think every shooter should be able to do. If you can't do them consistently, then you shouldn't expect to score goals. What'd you guys think? What was your favorite part? My favorite part was probably when Damien was trying to teach me how to dodge. It didn't really work too much but he tried his best. Yeah, I mean, that's one of those things that you learn over time.

{"video_id": "Iznzpxx4UNM", "event_id": 2, "begin": 57.203, "end": 319.038, "pred": "Alright guys, that was the brand-new CS-1. It's a pretty cool gun. I'm not sure if you can see in there but it has an internal regulator. So what that means is there's no external regulator on this gun at all. It's actually built into the body of the gun itself. And what that does for us is it allows us to run any kind of tank we want. We don't have to worry about pressure or anything like that. So let's take a look at how many shots we got off here. I think we did pretty good. Let's check out our count.  Okay, so three pods. That's about 1,200 shots. Not bad! Now, one thing we noticed while shooting is that the trigger was really sensitive. And by that I mean if you were holding your finger on the trigger too long, then it would start shooting automatically. Now, one way around that is to put some grease on your trigger. But another way is to use an anti-recoil device such as a grip saver. That will help prevent any accidental firing. But overall, guys, this gun shot great. The accuracy was really nice. It had some nice power behind it. And for those who aren't familiar with the CS-1, let me tell you a little bit more about it. This gun has been designed from the ground up specifically for speed ballers. What they wanted to do was make something that could shoot as fast as possible. They also wanted something that was easy to maintain. One of the things they did to accomplish these goals was to make everything modular. This means that every part can be taken apart and cleaned very easily. Another thing they did was design everything to fit together very tightly. They didn't want any parts moving around inside the gun. So they used high quality materials such as aluminum and stainless steel. As far as performance goes, this thing shoots extremely well. It's rated between three hundred and four hundred feet per second. In fact, we shot ours at over five hundred feet per second. It's also capable of shooting anywhere between two thousand two hundred rounds per minute and twenty-five hundred rounds per minute depending on how much air you have left in your tank. Another neat feature is that it comes in both right-handed and left-handed models. There's even a special version called the CS-1 Pro which includes a few extra features. For example, it comes with a custom-made barrel sleeve which allows you to change barrels without having to take the whole gun apart. It also comes with a custom-made grip saver which helps prevent accidental firing. If you'd like to learn more about the CS-1 Pro then click the link below.

A big win for the Terps. Maryland jumped out early scoring the first three goals of the game. UNC answered with a couple of goals, but Maryland responded with a 5-0 run to end the first half. In the second half, UNC tried to make a push but couldn't do enough against the Terp defense. Maryland held UNC to only four goals in the second half. Connor Kelly had three goals and two assists in this game. Luke Bateman added another three goals and an assist. The Terrapins will be back home next week when they host Johns Hopkins.

It also makes your muscles less likely to cramp during training because they're already warmed up from the stretching. And then finally, it also reduces soreness afterwards.

So again, hands behind your head, elbows out, arms straight, feet flat on the ground, core tight, shoulders pulled back, abs tight, and then sit all the way up, touch your knees, come back down, repeat.
