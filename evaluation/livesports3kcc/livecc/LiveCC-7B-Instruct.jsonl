It's called Bulgarian split squats. Now, I've seen a lot of different ways people do these things. Some guys will use dumbbells. Some guys will use barbells. But I prefer using the Smith machine just because... The Smith machine has a nice smooth motion. It's easy to control. And if you don't have access to a Smith machine, you could probably find something else that works. So basically, what you want to do is make sure you're standing on the side of the machine where you're going to be standing on. So let's say we're working right foot first. We're going to stand on the left side of the machine. Find a point in the wall and focus on it. Push your chest up. Keep your head up. Don't drop your shoulders. That's how you lose your form. And then basically, you're going to sink your hips as far as you can without letting your butt fall behind you. And then explode up. Try and push your heel into the ground. Push your toes up towards the ceiling. And just repeat those steps. Control the movement. Keep your chest up. Focus on the point in the wall. And..."}

Alrighty, so... The first thing I want to say about these sets is they were very light. And by very light, I mean literally like nothing. But it's just kind of weird because I haven't done these sets before. It's something new. So I don't know what to expect. If I should be able to do them easily, if I shouldn't be able to do them easily. But they went well. They went smooth. They didn't feel too bad. My lower back wasn't hurting. Everything looked pretty good. So I'm gonna keep working up until I find a max effort set. And then after that, I will probably move into some singles. Maybe even doubles just to build up my confidence. Because I am not confident in doing triples yet. So I might as well start building up my confidence with singles and doubles.

Like my face looks better with this shirt than without it. My face looks like a potato chip. It's like crispy. But anyways, let's head to the gym. And hopefully we can do some good stuff today. See you guys at the gym. Oh yeah, also, if you haven't seen my last video yet, please check out my last video where I talk about the importance of warm -up sets. So make sure you watch that before watching this one. Alright, see you guys at the gym. Oh, by the way, also, I forgot to mention that I did 10 sets of push-ups as well. So here's the first set of incline bench press. As you can tell, I'm doing a lot more reps compared to my last video. That's because I've been working on increasing my reps instead of increasing weight. That's how I'm going to build muscle mass. Also, I'm using a slightly wider grip because I feel like it helps me engage my chest more. Also, as you can tell, I'm keeping my elbows tucked in close to my body. This will help me keep tension on my chest throughout the entire set. As you can tell, I'm doing a slight pause at the bottom of each rep. This will allow me to engage my chest even further. Now, here's the second set. Now, I'm doing a little bit heavier than the first set. However, I'm only doing eight reps. The reason being is because I'm trying to work on building muscle mass and strength. If I were to increase weight too much, I would be doing too many reps which wouldn't give me enough time for my muscles to recover. And since I have other exercises coming up later in the day, I need to make sure my muscles are fully rested. Alright, so after the incline bench press, I decided to take a break from the gym and eat something. Because I didn't bring any food with me, I had to stop by Dunkin' Donuts and buy myself some food. Unfortunately, they ran out of their chicken sandwiches, but luckily they had turkey sandwiches left. So I got two turkey sandwiches and a medium coffee. And while I was waiting there, I saw a bunch of people buying doughnuts. And I thought to myself, man, these people must love doughnuts. Because they bought three doughnuts each. And I think one of them bought four. Anyways, back to the workout. Here's the third set of incline bench press. Again, I'm doing eight reps. However, I'm doing slightly less weight compared to the second set. And again, that's because I'm trying to focus on building muscle mass and strength rather than just focusing on lifting heavy weights. And speaking of heavy weights, did anyone else notice how heavy these plates are? They're like freaking iron. Like seriously, you could probably use those plates to kill someone. Or maybe not. Anyway, moving on to the fourth exercise. Here's the dumbbell fly. I'm doing six sets of ten reps. Again, I'm doing light weights because I'm trying to focus on building muscle mass rather than just focusing on lifting heavy weights. And as you can tell, I'm keeping my arms straight throughout the entire exercise. This will help me..."}

This is the final race of day number one for us. We've got the men's 200 meters here in the Virginia Showcase. We have six runners in this field. The fastest runner is from George Mason. He ran a 21 flat earlier today. So he'll be looking to go under that mark again tonight. And then we also have a couple other guys who can run fast times too. But it looks like they're all getting off to a pretty good start right now. It looks like George Mason has taken over early. He's got that lead there on the inside lane. And then we've got somebody else kind of battling with him there. And then we've got some more guys coming up behind them. Looks like we might even have another guy trying to make his way through there. So it should be a really close finish here. But right now, it looks like George Mason is taking control of things early. They're starting to pull away just slightly. They're about three or four lengths ahead of everybody else. And then we've got somebody else trying to come through from the back end of the pack. But it looks like George Mason will take home the win here. It looks like they're going to get under 21 flat.

The roads aren't too bad, but there's some puddles and mud patches. So far, so good. The bike feels comfortable. It's got 32mm tyres on it. They're tubeless ready, so they should run nice and low pressure. And then the suspension fork is doing its job as well. There's no harshness through the bars. Feels really smooth. Very comfortable. Really enjoying riding this bike already. We're now heading into some more single track. A little bit of climbing. Again, the bike feels really comfortable. Nice and stable. Not feeling any harshness coming through the bars. Now onto the fire road climb. Fire road climbs are always a test of a bike. How does it feel when you're pedaling uphill? Doesn't feel too heavy. Still feels light enough to pedal uphill. And then we're onto the final section which is a single track descent. Again, feels really comfortable. No harshness through the bars. Really enjoying this bike. So overall, what did I think of the Canyon Grizzly CFSL8? Well, for the price point, you'd expect a lot of compromise. But actually, there wasn't many compromises at all. The frame felt very stiff. The fork didn't add much weight. The tyres were tubeless ready. The brakes worked well. The drivetrain was fine. Everything seemed to work fine. The bottle cage mount was handy. The saddle was comfy. The seat post clamp was adjustable. The front brake mount was adjustable. The rear brake cable was long enough. The chainstay protector was long enough. The bar tape was decent quality. The handlebar was decent quality. The stem was decent quality. The fork was decent quality. The wheels weren't bad. The wheels weren't brilliant. But overall, everything else was pretty good.

Now, when I grab his ankle, I've got two options. I can either go for a ball and chain or a crossbody. If I go for a ball and chain, what I'm going to do is I'm going to come underneath his knee, grab his foot, and now I'm going to start to pull myself up.

And I don't know if he'll have the confidence to go for this green. It's a long way away. But he might need to do that. Because he's only two over par for the tournament. So he could still make something happen.   That's a great putt.   Yeah, well done.   Well, we've seen some amazing shots today. We saw a couple of eagles earlier on. There were some really good putts made as well. But we haven't seen many birdies.  Oh, what a shot!  What a putt!   Yes!   Great stuff.   Good luck, man.   Congratulations.   Come on, Jiggler.

We want to make sure that our feet are shoulder width apart. We don't want them too close together because then we won't have enough room to get down into our squat position. And if they're too far out, then when we go to shoot, it's not going to feel right. It's going to feel like we're shooting way over here. So we need to keep them nice and even.

There's no run -up. And yeah, it's a bit slippery as well because it's been raining all morning. But the bike seems to be handling that okay.  Okay, so we're coming into the second climb now. This is a little bit more technical. There's a lot of rocks in the middle section. But yeah, the bike's doing fine. Stage 1 done. Now onto stage 2.  So Stage 2 is a long descent downhill. Lots of loose stones here. Yeah, the bike's handling this nicely.  So after the descent, we come into another climb. Again, it's quite steep. No run -up.  A little bit muddy.

How many reps do you do per exercise? And what kind of dieting are you doing? Because this guy over here has been dieting for quite a while now. He's getting ready for a show. And so what does it take to be able to lift all these weights? What does it take to be able to lift all these weights when you've been dieting for months at a time?

What a great shot.   It's just so good.   I mean, you can see how much he wants this.   There we go.   Well, I think Rafael Nadal will be disappointed there because it was such a good opportunity. But Nadal did have another chance to take the lead when he broke again in game six.   Oh, what a shot.   Unbelievable.   Unbelievable.   Look at this.    Wow.   Unbelievable.

It's not just a rail or something. It's more like a bridge thing where you have to go up and then down again. So that's why I'm really excited for this one. Yeah, let's do it. The idea behind this is that Markus wants to try out the new trick called backside 360 to backside 540. So he has to go from front side and then spin around again. And he needs some space for that. And there's no other place in Helsinki except here under the bridge. There's enough room underneath the bridge so that he can actually do his tricks. But at the same time, there's also cars passing by all the time. So... That makes things even more interesting when you're doing your tricks. But yeah, we'll see how it goes...."}

And then I move over to the church side where I find myself getting shot at by one of our teammates. So I quickly move back behind cover and try to figure out what's going on. And sure enough, it turns out that he just got hit with his own paintball. So that's always good when your teammates start shooting each other. But anyways, after this, I decide to go ahead and head down towards the church again because there were a lot of people hiding around there. But as soon as I get there, I realize that they've all moved away. So I decided to head back to the middle of the field where I can have a better view of everything. As I'm moving through the middle here, I notice that one of our opponents has taken a position near the church. So I take him out before he gets too close to us. After taking him out, I decide to stay in the middle of the field since I know that most people will be coming from either side. Unfortunately, I don't really have any more kills after this, but I do manage to keep myself alive until the end of the game. Now, if you look closely at the bottom left corner of the screen, you'll notice that our team is actually winning right now. However, they only need two more kills to win the game. So even though we're not doing very well, we still want to help them out as much as possible. So I quickly run across the field towards the church area because I know that there are quite a few opponents hiding around there. Once I reach the church, I immediately take cover behind the wall and wait for someone else to come along. Luckily, another player comes running across the field and we both start looking for enemies. We spot a couple opponents hiding behind the spool and we take them out pretty easily. Then we turn our attention back towards the church and find ourselves being shot at from inside. So we quickly duck down and try to figure out which way he's coming from. It doesn't take long for us to figure out that he's coming from the left side of the church. So we quickly run over to the left side of the church and take him out. With these three kills, our team wins the round and we move on to the next one. Thanks for watching everyone. If you enjoyed the video, please..."}

She had a good trip in the race. She was able to sit off the pace. And when she needed her run, she came through with a big effort. But she wasn't really tested until the final furlong. And she did not look like a horse that could win this race. The way she ran down Hawksmore, who was running very well, but just didn't quite have enough to hold off Donna Bruja. And then... Grand Jetta came late. Kittens Roar also came late. They were all there. But it was DeSinta that took over at the end. And she won the race. Now, let's talk about some of these other horses. Rain Goddess ran a game second. She was able to stay close enough to the leaders so that she could make her move. She made her move too soon though. She should have waited until the final quarter mile. Then she would have had more time to catch up to the leader. But she did catch up to the leader. She caught up to DeSinta. But she couldn't hold off Donna Bruja. And Donna Bruja is a very nice horse. She's very fast. She can run anywhere from a mile down to a mile and a half. She's a very versatile horse. She likes to run on top of them or right behind them. She doesn't want to be too far back. And she has a lot of speed. She's a very nice horse. She's a very good horse. And she will be seen again. She may even go to New York. She might try for the Diana. That's another grade one. It's also a mile and a half. So she might try for that. Or maybe they'll send her to Kentucky. Maybe they'll send her to Churchill Downs. Maybe they'll send her to Kentucky. For the Kentucky Oaks. We don't know yet. But we'll see. Anyway, that's my recap of the race.

So the rest of the field are not far off. They're still within striking range. We saw Fabian Cancellara just jump across there. He's trying to get himself into position. He knows he needs to be right near the front of this race. And he's doing exactly that. He's jumping across. Now, Hessing, he's looking around. He's thinking, where am I? Where's my teammate? Where's my teammates? Because he's got no idea where they are. And now, Levi Leipheimer, he's giving it his best shot. He's got nothing left. He's absolutely spent. And this is going to be a great win for Robert Hessing. He's had a tough season. He's had a lot of injuries. He's had a lot of bad luck. He's had a lot of problems. And this is going to be a huge confidence boost for him. As he comes through here, he's got nothing left. He's completely spent. He's got no energy left. And Levi Leipheimer, he's completely exhausted. He's done his job. He's put in everything he could possibly put in. And Robert Hessing will take this stage victory. What a performance.

Well, we're back with our challenge. We're still waiting on the decision. We haven't heard anything yet. So we're going to show you again what happened. Darnell slides into second base. He gets tagged out by Kendrick. Now watch. As Kendrick goes to make sure he tags him, he lets go of his glove. That's when Hernandez comes around. So there's no way you could argue that there wasn't contact made with the glove. There certainly wasn't any doubt.   And so now we wait for the decision.  And this is why you want to make sure your guys stay put because if you leave them off the base, then you lose your challenge. If you do lose your challenge, then you cannot use it again until the next day. So even though the Dodgers had two challenges remaining, they would have lost their last challenge had they not won this challenge. So let's take another look.   Ball hit hard.   And so...   Let's hope that they overturn this and give us a better game than we saw last night.   And here's the call.   After review, the ruling on the field stands.

He won 19 Cup championships and over 200 races during his career. But this race in particular stands out because of how he beat Richard Petty on the last lap. Pearson was leading when the caution flag came out with three laps to go. When the green flag dropped, Petty tried to run him down, but Pearson had other plans. As they went through turn four, Petty tried to make a pass on the inside, but Pearson closed the door. Then, as they were coming off turn four, Petty made contact with Pearson's rear bumper. That caused Pearson to spin around into the infield grass. The caution came out again, giving Pearson enough time to change tires before the next restart. When the green flag dropped, Petty jumped out to a quick lead, but Pearson wouldn't give up. With two laps remaining, Pearson caught up to Petty and took the lead as they crossed the start -finish line. Pearson would hold on to win by less than a tenth of a second. It was the closest win in NASCAR history at the time. And it wasn't until 2003 that anyone else even came close to winning by that little margin. In fact, it wouldn't happen until 2014 when Kevin Harvick edged Martin Truex Jr. by .008 seconds. So if you want to see some of the best finishes ever, look no further than the Coke Zero Sugar 400.

So this is one of my favorite chokeholds in jiu -jitsu. It's a very powerful chokehold. It can be used from standing or it can also be used when you have your opponent on their knees. So I'm going to show you both ways how to do it today. Let's get into it. All right, so first thing we want to look at here is our stance. We don't want to stand too close because if he falls down like that, that's not good for us. We need to make sure we've got enough space to work with. If we're standing too close, then there's no way he's going to fall over. He'll just fall straight onto me. And now I'm stuck. I'm trying to escape but there's nowhere to go. He's still holding me tight. Nowhere to go. There's nothing I can do. So what we want to do is we want to keep some space between us. That gives him room to move around. If he does fall down, then we can come up behind his head and start working our choke. Okay? So let's take a look at the armless darts choke. First things first, we're going to grab his wrist. Now, if he has his hand free, this is where we would normally grab his wrist and pull it across our body. But since he doesn't have any hands, what we're going to do instead is we're going to put our elbow down on the mat. And as soon as we put our elbow down on the mat, we're going to bring our other hand underneath his neck. And we're going to use our elbow to push his chin into his chest. All right? So again, from here, we're grabbing his wrist. We're putting our elbow down on the mat. As soon as we put our elbow down on the mat, we're bringing our other hand under his neck. And using our elbow to push his chin into his chest. Okay? From here, all we're doing is we're pushing him forward. And once we get him forward, all we're going to do is we're going to bring our knee inside of his leg. And we're going to hook his leg with our foot. Once we hook his leg, now we're going to turn our hips away from him. And we're going to lift our hip off the ground. Alright? From here, let's take another look. Grabbing his wrist. Putting our elbow down on the ground. As soon as we put our elbow down on the ground, we're bringing our other hand under his neck. Using our elbow to push his chin into his chest. Pushing him forward. Hooking his leg with our foot. Turning our hips away from him. Lifting our hips off the ground. Now, from here, once we've lifted our hips off the ground, we're going to slide our knee through his legs. And we're going to lock our feet together. Now, from here, we're going to drop our weight onto his shoulder. And we're going to roll him over top of us. Okay? Once we've rolled him over top of us, we're going to switch sides.

So let's talk about some of those things now. So when you look at old film footage or even old VHS footage, it always has these really cool lines in them. It almost makes the image look more dynamic than what it actually is. But nowadays, especially with HD cameras, they don't have any of that. They're very clean. And so sometimes they can be a little bit boring looking. So how do you add some of that back into your images? Well, one way is by using motion blur. Motion blur happens when you take a picture and the camera moves during exposure. It creates streaking lines across the frame. The longer the exposure, the more motion blur will occur. To get motion blur, you need to use a slow shutter speed. The slower the shutter speed, the more motion blur will occur. If you're shooting handheld, try not to hold the camera steady while taking pictures. Instead, try to move along with the subject as much as possible. This will help keep the camera steady and create less shaking in the image. Another thing you can do to add some dynamic lines into your images is to use leading lines. Leading lines draw the viewer's eye into the scene. They also give the..."}

The rope clamp is attached to the climbers' rope before the start of the climb. It should be attached about 2 meters above the ground. When ascending, you pull the rope through the rope clamp and attach it to the carabiner. Now you can secure the climber with the brake hand below the carabiner. If there was no rope clamp, you would have to secure the climber with the brake hand up. In addition, it is much more difficult to get the rope untangled. To untangle the rope, you first release the brake hand from the brake rope. Then you pull the brake rope outwards until the knot comes loose.

And I think he'll be very happy with himself after that one. Yeah, great finish by him. Great work by Luke Marshall as well. Just getting round the outside of the defence...."}

They dominated the first set, winning it 25 -10. And then they won the second and third sets pretty easily too. So let's go ahead and get into that. First off, I want to talk about the serving. The serve was really good for them. They were able to put some pressure on Oregon State early on with that serve. And then... The defense was also very good. They had a lot of blocks throughout the entire match. They just kept putting pressure on Oregon State. And then when they got opportunities to hit, they took advantage of those opportunities. So overall, they played well against a tough Oregon State team. And now they'll be looking forward to playing Idaho next weekend.

Its rugged terrain is perfect for trail running. The second run takes us up Mount Field National Park. Mount Field National Park is located just outside of Hobart and offers a variety of different terrain from forested trails to rocky outcrops. The third run takes us back down to the coastline where we can enjoy the beautiful scenery that Hobart has to offer. We start at Tinderbox Reserve which offers a great mix of forest and coastal views. We then head up to Freycinet Peninsula where we get to enjoy the stunning cliffs and beaches along this coastline.

Now this is a very important part of your game because it's all about getting in the right mindset before we actually take our stroke. So what we need to do is get into a good stance position, make sure we've got our eyes looking at where we want to hit the ball, which is usually just behind the hole, make sure we've got the correct grip on the club as well. So if I was to show you how I would set up for my putt, first thing I'd do is get down onto my knees, look at the line of the putt, see exactly where I want to go. Now once I've done that, what I'll then do is come back up again, take a few practice swings with the putter, just so I can feel exactly how much pace I need to give the golf ball.

For the muscle -ups, you need to make sure that your arms are fully extended when you come down to the dip position. Your elbows should not bend as you transition from the dip to the pull-up. If you're having trouble getting the muscle -ups, scale to a dip plus a pull -up. Or you could even use bands to help assist that pull -up. After the muscle -ups, we're moving into handstand push -ups. Make sure that when you lower yourself into the dip position, your arms stay fully extended. No bending of the elbows. As you extend back up to the top, make sure that you keep those legs locked out so that you're not swinging through the motion. If you're struggling with the handstand push -ups, scale to using rings. or a box for support. After the handstand push -ups, we're moving on to toes to bar. Make sure that when you bring those knees up towards the bar, you're keeping them close to the body so that you're not swinging around too much.

And also, if you guys can help us out, please share this video as much as possible. We really need the support. So here we go. Now, right now, we're doing some cable rows. As you see, I'm using the rope attachment. It's actually a little bit more difficult to use than the straight bar attachment. You'll notice that when I pull back, my elbows come forward a lot more than they would if I were to use the straight bar attachment. But either way, it still works the same muscle group. The main thing that you want to focus on is pulling those elbows back towards your hips as far as you possibly can without letting your shoulders rotate too much. That's why I say the straight bar attachment is better because it keeps your arms closer to your body. That way you can keep your shoulders more stable. Also, another tip that I'd like to give you guys is try to keep your feet planted firmly into the ground while you're performing this movement. This helps with stability and keeping your core engaged. Another thing that you should focus on is squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. This helps engage your lats even further. Anyways, enough talking. Let's watch the rest of the video because I'm tired of talking..."}

It looked like they were going to make it back into racing position, but then they went over again. So they're still out there. It's very difficult sailing. We haven't done enough of these kind of conditions before. So we'll learn from today. Race three is underway with China against Japan. The Japanese crew have made a good start here.

But I thought they played pretty well. They were very competitive. And they'll be disappointed that they didn't get over the line there. It was a good effort from them.  The Bulldogs came out strong. They scored a couple early tries. We had some opportunities to score ourselves but couldn't quite get across the line. In the end, Bulldogs won the game 20 points to six. So not great result for us. We need to bounce back this week against Tully.  Moving up into our reserves grade team, we went down to Parklands. Again, another team that's been struggling recently.

And then after these, we did some speed deadlifts. These were at about... Let me see what they were. They were at about 250 for three sets of five. They felt pretty good. Not super fast, not super slow either. Just trying to find that sweet spot in between. And then finally, some snatch grip deadlifts off blocks. We've got four sets of three reps each. And again, these felt pretty good. I mean, nothing crazy heavy or anything. But just working on technique and making sure everything feels good. And then afterwards, we finished up with some accessory work. We did some dumbbell rows, some bent over rows, and some band pull -aparts. That was all the workout.

Look at Jesse Burns stepping in and taking the shot. He's got to get loose and move with him. Tovis, able to go big aboard Little Bob. And then Jesse Byrne takes the front of that bull and draws his attention away alongside Frank Newsome and Shorty Gorham.

But that's because I didn't really have time to aim well enough. Because I wanted to try to keep everything in frame. So what I did was I aimed down and then fired. And then I would move the camera over. And so... The shots were pretty much all grouped together. There's one shot way off to the left. That's probably me. Not the gun or anything. It's just me being a little sloppy. But let's take a look at the chronograph data. We'll do that next. And then we'll come back and discuss how the different loads performed.

And then there's the Neuron, which is more of a mountain bike with a longer travel fork, longer travel rear end, softer geometry, and a much wider handlebar.

So if you order it, it will come out of the box like this. Okay, so as you can see, everything is laid out right here. This is exactly what you get. First thing you get is... The quiver. It's a four arrow quiver. It has a sling on it. It also has a little pouch where you can keep extra arrows. And it does have a sight rail built into it. So you can mount a sight onto it.  Next thing you get is the scope. Now, you can either choose between these two scopes. They both come standard with the bow. Then you get the manual.

Today we're down in Annapolis, Maryland where Navy hosted Lehigh. The Mids won this one by a score of 14 -9. It was a very physical contest between these two teams. Both defenses played extremely well. But ultimately, it was the Mids' offense that proved to be the difference maker today. They had four different players scored multiple goals. And they really dominated the faceoff circle. They won 17 of 24 draws. That allowed them to have a ton of possession time throughout the course of the game. For Lehigh, they had some bright spots. Connor Sullivan had a career -high six points and three goals. He was also named Patriot League Player of the Week after scoring those six points. So that'll wrap things up for me. Thanks so..."}

So, if you haven't already, go ahead and check out my other videos where I talk about how to do a gainer and how to do a backflip. But basically, what you're going to do is just throw a gainer off of this. And when you throw it, you're going to want to land somewhere around here. Because if you land too close to the ledge, then you won't be able to clear the ledge. If you land too far away from the ledge, then you'll probably fall down onto your butt. So, yeah, you kind of want to aim for... somewhere around there. That's why I said before that you needed to be able to do a gainer off of a lower ledge.

So we're going to go over some side control attacks today. We've been working on side control for quite a while now. And one thing that we haven't really talked too much about is how to attack from the tight defense. So if your opponent has their hands on your hips, what do you do? What can you do when they're really defending well? Well, let me show you something here. If he's got his hand on my hip, he's got his elbow in, and he's keeping it close, it makes it very difficult for me to get any kind of submission off. But if I'm able to get my arm under his arm, I can start attacking his wrist lock. And so that's where we're going to start with our first attack. Okay, so here's the situation. My partner's got his hands on my hips. His elbows are in. It's hard for me to get anything going right now because he's just defending super tight. What I want to do is try to get my arm underneath this space between his elbow and his body. Okay, so as soon as I can get my arm underneath there, I'm going to grab my own wrist. Now, once I've done that, I'm going to take my head out of the way. Now, notice how I'm using my shoulder to push against his shoulder. This is going to help me keep him away from me. Once I've pushed him back, now I'm going to bring my knee up into his armpit. As I do that, I'm going to push down on his wrist. As I push down on his wrist, I'm going to pull him towards me. Notice how I'm pulling him towards me. Once I've pulled him towards me, I'm going to use my knee to block his hip. From here, all I need to do is turn my palm downwards and finish the lock. If I feel like he's trying to defend by putting pressure on my wrist, all I need to do is lift my chest up and finish the lock. All right, so again, from here, I'm going to put pressure with my shoulder. Pushing his shoulder away from me. Grabbing my own wrist. Taking my head out of the way. Knee comes up into his armpit. Pushing down on his wrist. Pulling him towards me. Knee blocks his hips. Turn my palm downwards. Finish the lock. All right, so let's see if we can work through some reps together. Let's go ahead and switch sides.   From here, again, pushing his shoulder away from me. Grabbing my own wrist. Taking my head out of the way. Knees come up into his armpit.

So we're still in the same layout. We're just switching sides. The red team will start on the left side. The blue team will start on the right side. And we're going to try to take each other out again. So let's see how this goes.   All right, guys, so we've switched over to the second game. We're starting off strong. Trevor's already down. He's being shot by two different people. But we're holding him off. We're keeping him pinned down. And we're making sure that they don't get any kills right away. And then we're going to move forward from there. But it looks like we're going to lose him. Yeah, that's unfortunate. That's okay though. We can always replace people.  Okay, so we're moving along nicely. We're pushing forward. We're taking out a few more players. We're slowly getting closer to the enemy side. And we're looking good. We're looking good. We're looking good.   There's a guy coming through here. He's going to get taken out.   What happened?   I didn't even know you were there.   Hey, man.   All right, guys, so we're pushing forward. We're taking out a couple more enemies. We're getting closer and closer to the enemy side. We're looking good. We're looking strong. Let's keep it up.   All right, guys, so we lost this game. We went down 12 -6. Not too bad. We played well. We did everything we could. We pushed hard. We took out as many as we could. And unfortunately, they came back at us. They were able to push forward. We weren't able to stop them. And we couldn't hold them off long enough. So we lost this game. Now we're moving on to the third game. We're going to switch sides again. We're going to start on the left side. And we're going to try to take these guys out. Hopefully we can win this one.   All right, guys, so we're starting off strong. We're trying to pin down this guy. We're trying to take him out. We're trying to get rid of him before anybody else gets to him. Because if anybody else gets to him first, he's probably going to take us all out. So we need to get rid of him first.   All right, guys, so we won our last game. We beat them 12 to 6. We started off slow, but we picked it up later. We were able to get a bunch of kills. We were able to push forward. We were able to hold them off. We were able to keep them pinned down. And we were able to win. So overall, it was a great day. Great turnout. A lot of people showed up. We met some new faces. We had a great time. We learned a lot. We improved. We grew as a team.

And this is just a great overall quad exercise. You know, you don't have to go heavy on these. It's not about the weight. It's more about getting good reps. So if you feel comfortable with 200 pounds, then go ahead and use that. If you feel comfortable with 150 or even less, then by all means, use that. But what you want to focus on is making sure that you get a good stretch and a good contraction. So coming down, make sure you push those knees out. Make sure you push them past parallel. And then when you come up, squeeze those quads together. Make sure they're tight. Don't let them bounce around. Also, another thing that I see a lot of people do wrong is they lift their butt up off the seat. That takes the tension off the legs and puts it onto your lower back. So keep your butt firmly planted into the seat. Keep your feet flat onto the platform. And again, anywhere between 12 to 15 reps. That's ideal. If you need to drop down to eight, nine, ten, then by all means, but definitely no less than eight. And also, you want to make sure you don't rush through the movement. Take your time. Get a good stretch. Get a good contraction. And that's biggie's tip of the day. Leg presses. Let's do it. Biggie's tip of the day. Leg presses. Let's do it. Biggie's tip of the day. Leg presses.

But if I did everything correctly, my head stayed up, my shoulders didn't move, everything was good, no water comes out. The other thing we could do is kicks. So again, same idea. If I were to drop my head down, move my hips, anything like that, it'd be really hard to kick without spilling the water. But if I kept everything tight, kept my head up, didn't jerk my hips, nothing like that, no water spills out...."}

One, two. Almost a three. Wow.  These Candy Kings are looking good.   Well, it looks like the Candy Kings will win this match. It's almost over.   What a debut for the Candy Kings.   Aubry Rose calls for the bell.  Candy Kings winning their Valor Arena debut.   Robbie Landell showing some signs of life there.   Butchering him up.   Oh, wow.   That was an impressive move.   And the Candy King's victory has been confirmed.   So, what did you think of their debut?  I thought they looked pretty good.  Their striking was very effective.  And Landell showed signs of life towards the end. So maybe he'll come back next week. Maybe he won't. We'll see.   But overall, great debut. Great debut.

But what I wanted to show you with this clip was how my form has changed over the past few weeks. If you look at the first couple of clips, the bar is moving quite quickly down to the bottom. However, now what I'm doing is really focusing on keeping a slow tempo and making sure that I'm driving through my heels. My elbows are staying nice and high throughout the entire movement. And I'm keeping my chest up high. So if you compare these two clips together, you'll notice that there's a huge difference between how fast the bar moves down to the bottom.

He went after it. And then he put it right past Matalora. Now here comes RIT. Colavecchia. Backhanded pass. Noyes. Noyes. Shot. Save made. Rebound. Another save. Still loose. Puck still loose. Tigers have it. They'll shoot. Save made. Bert has it. Bert ahead. Bert into the empty net. Bert scores! Cameron Bert with the game winner in overtime. And the Tigers win it 3 -2. What a great individual effort there by Bert. Just took it himself and beat the goaltender. That's why I said he's such a good player because he doesn't need a lot of room. He's not afraid to take shots. And he's got a nice shot. And just... A great individual effort there by Cameron Bert. And the Tigers win it three to two in overtime. Well, we talked about how important this game was for both teams. Well, I think it was more important for Robert Morris than for RIT. But nonetheless, they were able to pull out the victory tonight. So congratulations to them. We thank you for joining us here on S2 Live...."}

And I must say, these brakes are super smooth. They feel great when you're riding them. They're very quiet. The only downside is that they're a little bit longer than your typical Shimano brake lever. So if you have a short reach handlebar, you might run into some issues. But other than that, they work great. They're nice and quiet. They're easy to adjust. And they come with this cool little tool that allows you to adjust the reach of the lever. Now, since I already had the brakes bled, all I had to do was bleed the reservoir. If you haven't done any bleeding yourself, I would recommend watching my video on how to bleed your hydraulic disc brakes. It should help you out quite a bit. Alright, well, enough talking. Let's go ahead and take another run down the hill.  Okay, so after taking a few runs downhill, I decided to head back home and try out the brakes on the road. So I started at 17 miles per hour again and stopped in 16 feet. That's almost two feet shorter than the original M200 brakes. That's a huge difference. These brakes definitely have better stopping power. Let's go ahead and check out the results on the graph. and compare them side by side.

Today I'm talking about Jackson Powell, who just broke the world record for a 17 year old in the open weight class with his 900 pound squat. He also broke his own bench press record by adding another plate to his total. So let's get into this. First off, he was able to hit a new PR on his first meet of the year. He went up from an opener of 377 .5 kilos to 405 kilos for a second attempt. He then decided to go all out and try for 425 kilos for his third attempt. This would have been a huge PR if he had been able to pull it off. But unfortunately, he didn't quite make it all the way down. So that left him with a total of 842 .5 kilos. Now moving on to his deadlift, he opened with 292 .5 kilos, which was pretty easy for him. Then he moved on to his squats. Now here comes the fun stuff. His opener was 379 kilos, which was already a big PR for him. Then he moved on to his second attempt, where he added another plate to the bar. And guess what? It wasn't enough. He needed more than two plates to break the world record. So he decided to add three plates to the bar for his final attempt. And guess what? It worked! He managed to pull it off and set a new world record for the youngest person ever to squat over 900 pounds. That's right, folks. The kid did it again. After finishing up his squats, he moved on to his last event, deadlift. For his opener, he went with 410 kilos, which was pretty easy for him as well. Then he moved on to his second attempt, where he added another plate to the bar. Unfortunately, he couldn't hold onto it long enough to finish the rep. So this left him with a total of 927 .5 kilos. Overall, he finished first place in the open men's division with a total of 2 ,045 pounds. That's right, folks. The kid did it again. I hope you enjoyed this video.

And then also give you guys some tips that will help you get more out of your front squat. So let's go ahead and jump right into it.  Alright, so first thing first, when you grab the barbell, make sure you have a good grip. Make sure you don't choke down too far because if you choke down too far, it'll be hard to keep your elbows upright throughout the movement. But make sure you have a good grip. And then from there, we want to put our feet about shoulder width apart. Now, depending on your build, you may need to go wider or narrower than that. But just find something comfortable where you can keep your knees tracking over your toes. Then once you've got those things set, we're going to take the weight and place it onto our shoulders. We're going to use our traps to hold it in place. Once we've done that, we're going to take a step back. Now, depending on your height, some people might not even need to take a step back. They could just stand straight up. But since I am taller, I actually had to take a little bit of a step back. From there, we're going to sit back as if we were sitting in a chair. So we're going to sit back, keeping our chest nice and tall. Keeping our head up. Looking forward. And then from there, we're going to drive through our heels. Pushing our hips all the way down until they touch the ground. And then coming back up. Now, one tip is to try to keep your elbows locked in position throughout the entire movement. That way you can really focus on driving through your heels and getting full range of motion. Also, another thing is to try to keep your upper body as still as possible. That way you can focus on using your legs to drive yourself up. All right, now let's talk about the setup for the front squat.

If you have any questions, leave them down below.  Alright guys, so one thing I wanted to talk about today is eye focus. Now when we're talking about eye focus, we're talking about where your eyes are focused during the shot. A lot of people say they focus on their arrow. That's fine. Some people even say they focus on their target. That's also fine. What I do when I'm focusing during the shot is I focus right behind my arrow. So as soon as I draw my bowstring, I look through my peep site and I focus right behind my arrow. And once I let go of the nock, I'll follow the arrow until it hits its mark. And then I'll stop following it. The reason why I do that is because as soon as I release the nock, there's a little bit of movement in the string. There's a little bit of movement in the bow. There's a little bit of movement in my hand. And there's a little bit of movement in my body. So if I try to follow the arrow too long, by the time I stop following it, all those movements have already happened. So I might miss my target. If I just follow it until it hits its mark, then I can let go of the nock and everything else stays where it needs to stay. So give that a try. Let me know how it works for you.

And then once he gets closer to the lip, now he starts angling more towards shore. That's another key thing to watch for. But again, look at how gradual he is in getting onto the wave. He doesn't go straight down the face of the wave. He takes time to get on the wave. Now, once he does get on the wave, he's able to tap into gravity a lot quicker.

And it looks like we might have a new leader coming up. It's going to be the Drexel Dragons who are currently leading this race by just a seat or so. The Princeton Tigers are trying to come back. The Coxon is urging them forward. They're looking for that final push. But right now, it's the Drexel Dragons who are leading this race. As they approach the finish line, they should win this race. And we see the Princeton Tigers finishing strong. It was a great battle between these two teams. But right now, it's the Drexel Dragons who will finish first. And then followed closely behind by the Princeton Tigers. So congratulations once again to both teams. Great effort from both crews. And I'm sure there were many lessons learned today.

They've had a lot of success at the Ivy League level. They were second in the Ivy League last year. And they have some really strong races coming up against Columbia and Cornell this weekend. So it'll be interesting to see how that goes. But right now, it looks like Princeton is leading early. And I'm not sure if you can tell from here, but there's actually quite a bit of space between them. So maybe we'll get a little closer look as they come down the course. But yeah, so far, looks like Princeton is leading. We'll keep our eye on that. But yeah, let me know what you guys think about these races. We'll try to do more commentary for you guys later on.

So let me show you how bad this thing really is. We'll start off by measuring the height of the ramp itself. And then we will go down and measure the width of the coping. So let's do some measurements first before we get into the actual riding part. Let's check out the height first. The height of the ramp is actually quite good. It's around 1 .5 meters. That's perfect. Now let's take a look at the width of the coping. As you might be able to tell already, there isn't any coping. But if we would measure the width anyway, we'd say it's around one meter wide. But as you probably know, that's way too narrow. That's not even half a meter. Yeah, so that's definitely not enough.   Okay, now you saw the measurements. You saw the height. You saw the width. Now let's try to ride it. First things first, how does it feel? Well, it feels like... Like your board is going to slip away. Because there's nothing holding your board onto the ramp. The coping is way too narrow. And because of that, there's basically no grip whatsoever. And also, because of the lack of grip, there's no control either. So you cannot control where you want to land or where you want to stop.   Also, if you were to grind on this ramp, well, you wouldn't be able to grind anywhere. There's literally nowhere for you to grind. If you wanted to do a kickflip, well, you could maybe do a kickflip here, but then again, you won't be able to land it properly. So yeah, basically, this ramp has no use at all. And yeah, now let's give it a shot. Let's see if we can make something out of this. Maybe a little bit of a trick. Maybe a little bit of a trick...."}

First things first, what's your name?  What's your name?   Come here.   All right, so we're starting off with a bit of a climb.   Just to test out the camera. So, as I said earlier, today I'm using the Hero 5 Black Edition. The reason why I bought this over the Hero 5 Session is because I wanted something that had a touchscreen.  Obviously, when you're wearing gloves, you need to be able to change settings quickly while you're riding.  And also, because I didn't know whether I was going to use it for vlogging or anything else, having a touchscreen made sense. Now, obviously, the biggest difference between these two cameras is the fact that one is waterproof and one isn't.  However, for mountain biking, waterproofing is pretty much useless anyway.  If you drop it into water, it's still going to break.  So, yeah, touchscreen makes sense. Waterproofness doesn't make any sense...."}

So as soon as they learn to carry themselves in their own body, they don't need us so much anymore. They can carry themselves and stay steady on our hands. And that's where leg yield comes into play. It helps them develop that self -carriage. It helps them learn to use their back legs better. It helps them learn to use their hind legs better. It helps them stay balanced. It helps them stay straighter. Leg yield is a great exercise for that. Now, if you have a horse who has a tendency to lean out or who tends to fall asleep on his neck when you're doing leg yielding, you might want to try something different. Maybe you could try shoulders in instead of leg yield. Or maybe you could try... circles around yourself or circles around a cone instead of leg yielding. But remember, leg yielding is a great way to address symmetry issues as well as help develop the self -carriage of the horse.

We will start off with the most common way of tying the handbrake in top -rope mode. First, you hold the rope coming from the climber and the one going up the wall in both hands. Then you pull down the climbers' rope until there is enough slack to tie the handbrake. Now you form a loop with the cable coming from the climber and pass it under the other loop. Pull tight and adjust the length of the loops. It should be about 10 centimeters long. If they're too short, they won't work properly. And if they're too long, they might get caught on something while climbing. Afterwards, you pull the rope coming from the climber again until there is enough slack to tie another half -mast throw. Again, pass the rope underneath the first loop and tighten everything up. In case you want to lower someone, there are some differences compared to lowering yourself. Firstly, you don't use the top rope but the bottom one. Secondly, when you lower yourself, you always use the same hand for pulling the rope. But when you want to lower someone else, you switch hands after each throw. This way, you avoid accidentally getting stuck by the rope. So let's go through the steps once more...."}

But if you stay low, and you use your legs, your hips, to drive off the ground, then you're going to be able to get some power behind that shot. Now, as soon as you catch the ball, you're going to drop your head down so you can see the cage. Then you're going to drive off the ground. Boom!  Drive off the ground. Drop your head down. Look at the cage. Boom!..."}

His biggest problem was that he was hitting too many double faults. But since he started training with me, his double fault rate has gone down significantly.   That's better. Yeah, okay.   One thing I've noticed with Enzo is that when he serves, the ball tends to be a little bit low. It doesn't always hit that high point in the air.  So one thing I'm going to ask him to work on today is trying to hit the ball higher in the air...."}

Today we're talking about Denver and Towson. Towson started off strong against the Pioneers today. They jumped out to a three -goal lead early in the first quarter thanks to some great work down low by Ryan Doherty and some nice passing from the midfield. But Denver wasn't done yet. The Pioneers came roaring back in the second quarter with a couple of goals from Ryan Creighton to make it a one-goal game again. And then they went on a run after halftime that put them ahead for good. Creighton had a big game for the Pioneers, finishing with four goals and two assists. He was joined by teammate Brendan O'Donnell, who had three goals of his own. For more information on this game and others, check us out at InsideLacrosse .com or follow us on Twitter at EpochLax.

And that's pretty much what I expected. It's a little high for me. But it's still within the box. Six point four grains. That's perfect. Nice tight grouping there. Six point six grains. Another nice grouping. A couple shots went down here. But overall, pretty darn good. Seven grains.  Pretty darn good. Now, if you notice, these shots were all taken at different times. These three were taken one after another. And then I took another shot. And then I took a break. And then I came back and fired those two. So, you can tell there's some variation between them. But overall, really good results. The only thing I don't like is this one shot.  Right here.  Not sure why that happened. Let me show you something else. Okay, so let's take a close-up look at this. So we got... We got our six grains. Our six point four grains. Six point six grains.  Seven grains.  And then seven grains again.  And then right here.   There's no powder residue.  No primer residue. Nothing.  So what I think happened is when I pulled the trigger on this shot,  my gun wasn't cocked.  Because if you remember,  I did fire three rounds in succession. Then I took a break. Fired two more. And then fired this one.  So maybe after firing those three rounds, I forgot to slide lock the gun open.  And maybe that caused an issue. Maybe the primer wasn't striking or whatever. But anyway, so far, CFE Pistol has been awesome.  I mean, even though I had issues with this last shot, but still, not too shabby.  So, yeah, I'd say between six and six point four grains is probably your best bet.  If you want to try something heavier, go ahead. Just keep in mind your recoil might increase.

It's time now for our match highlights from the women's doubles. Karina Vito and Anastasia Rodionova taking on Svetlana Kuznetsova and Yelena Davydova. The Russians were favourites in this one but it was Vito who got off to the better start. She broke early in set number one. She had her chances at 3 -0 but couldn't convert them into break points. The Russian pair then broke back immediately to level things up. But again, it was Vito who had the edge as she went on to take out the first set by six games to four. And that momentum carried over into the second as she took the opening three games without dropping a game. But then the Russians started to find their range. They won five straight games before Kuznetsova closed out the second set with a double fault. And they're backing up what we saw last year when they reached the final here. So they'll be looking to go one step further this year. They've already beaten the defending champions in round two. Now they face the number three seeds, Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza tomorrow night. That will be a tough test for the Russians. In the meantime, though, they can celebrate their place in the third round after beating Vito and Rodionova by six games to four in both sets. A good win there for them. It takes just over an hour and a half to do the job. So that's how it finished. Kuznetsova and Davydo taking out Vito and Rodionova by six games to four sets each. Well done to them.

So after doing the overhead press, we moved on to incline dumbbell presses. We did three sets of ten reps each. And I believe our working weight was around 120 pounds. But yeah, these were pretty easy. We didn't do any warm -up sets either. So we just jumped straight into it. And yeah, they're pretty easy. They're very good for your triceps. If you can't do them, you should definitely try them out. They're great for building your triceps. Our final exercise was dumbbell lateral raises. We did three sets of 12 to 15 reps each. Our working weight was around 40 pounds. These were also very easy. Afterwards, we decided to add some extra volume by adding some drop sets. So we added two drop sets onto this exercise. So basically, after finishing your third set, you would take away one plate from both sides of the dumbbells and then finish your fourth set. Then once again, you would take away another plate from both sides and finish your fifth set. This is called a drop set. It's a great way to build muscle mass and strength. Alright, so moving on to back. We did four exercises. First being lat pulldowns. Then we moved on to pull-ups. Then we moved on to bent over rows.

Now, this wave is moving fast enough to where he doesn't need a huge amount of speed to make it. But if you think about Mason's wave, you know, we saw that wave move at least twice as fast.

But first off, let me show you guys how I did with bench press. So I started off here with 335 for three reps. It feels pretty good. It looks pretty decent. The only thing I noticed is that I kind of got pitched back a little bit more than I wanted to. However, it still looked okay. So I moved on to deadlifts. Here's my daily max for deadlifts. This is 500 pounds. I've done more weight than this before, but not recently. My hands were hurting from Friday's workout, which was a lot of grip work. So they weren't feeling too great. Then I decided to try to hit a double with 525. Now, I didn't want to go crazy high because I knew my hands were hurting. But as you can see, I got stuck halfway through the second rep.

Once we've got some good comfortable time riding around without our hands on the handlebars, we can move on to actually trying out a bar spin. When attempting your first bar spin, find something to hold onto as a safety..."}

It's week five day three of my meet prep for the APF Illinois State and Equipped Nationals. So I did some speed squats with a cambered barbell with bands. So this was 215 pounds for ten reps twice through. And then after that, I moved into some... Close grip bench press work. And so what I did here was just do sets of eight reps at about 85 % or so. And it felt pretty good. The only thing I would say is that I need to get better at keeping my elbows in line with my wrists because they're kind of flaring outwards as you can see here. But overall, it feels like I've made some progress in terms of getting stronger on these. Then afterwards, I went into some deadlifts. And so what I did here was just do two sets of six reps each time. And so I started off with 315 pounds. Then I moved up to 335 pounds. And then finally, I moved up to 355 pounds. And all of those were done off of a box. And so I think that I could probably go heavier than this if I wanted to. But since I have to compete from the floor, I decided not to take any chances and just stick with these lighter weights. And then lastly, what I did was just some accessory work. So I did three sets of ten repetitions per set of stiff legged deadlifts with 135 pounds. And then after that, I did three sets of ten repetitions per set of hip thrusts with 135 pounds. And then finally, I finished things up with some glute bridges where I did four sets of ten repetitions each time. So thanks..."}

Boom has been one of the most popular cyclists at the Tour of Britain, and he's also had a great season so far. He won the Criterium du Dauphine, the prologue stage of the Giro d'Italia, and then took second place behind Bradley Wiggins in the Olympic Games road race. But despite his impressive list of achievements, he still hasn't won a major tour. And when asked about this after the time trial, he said, Well, I'd like to win a grand tour. That's something that I haven't done yet. That's probably the biggest thing for me. I've come close before, so hopefully one day I'll manage to pull it off. Boom finished third overall in the Tour de France in 2010, behind Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck. When asked whether he thought Schleck might have been able to beat him on the day, he said, Well, you never really know until you ride together. Obviously, we were riding together last year, and he did very well. So maybe if we rode again, maybe he could go faster than me. Boom's performance today wasn't quite enough to take him back into the top three, though. He ended fourth overall, ahead of his HTC Highroad teammate Mark Renshaw. The Australian finished sixth overall after finishing fourth in the time trial. Renshaw was disappointed by his performance at the Tour of Britain, which saw him lose ground to Dowsett in the GC battle. I didn't expect to be fighting for the yellow jersey today, but obviously Alex Dowsett went away early and managed to stay away all day long. We tried to chase him down, but unfortunately couldn't catch him. So yeah, not too bad, though. Ended up second place, which is good. Yeah, just disappointed that I couldn't win the race.

Today we're going to go over some mobility exercises that I like to use before my workouts. I'm not saying these are the only ones you should do, just what works for me. So let's get into it. First up, we have the band lat stretch. We want to make sure our shoulders are warmed up so they don't get injured during the workout. And this will help loosen them up. So grab a band, tie it around something stable, and then step away from it. Then reach across your body and hold onto the other end of the band. From here, bend at the hips and lean forward until you feel a good stretch through your lats. Hold this position for about 30 seconds before switching sides. Repeat this process two times per side. Next up, the hamstring stretch. The hamstrings play a big role in most movements, especially deadlifts and squats. If they're tight, they could cause lower back pain or even knee pain if left unaddressed. To perform this stretch, grab a rope or towel and loop it behind your foot. Stand tall with your chest out and head looking straight ahead. Slowly sit down while keeping your feet flat on the ground..."}

So basically, what you want to do is stand in front of the stick, and then jump up into a backflip, but instead of landing on both feet, land on one foot. And when you land on one foot, make sure that you don't fall over to the side because if you do, then... Yeah, you might break your leg. Okay, so here's Zachary demonstrating it. He's standing in front of the stick, he jumps up, lands on his left leg, and doesn't fall over. And yeah, that's really all there is to it. Just practice until you feel comfortable doing this.

So practice makes perfect. Practice those three things. Get the racket a foot below the contact point. Make sure the racket face is closed at the low point of the backswing.

So I'm excited for them and looking forward to seeing how they do.  The swim here today was a little bit different than what we've seen in years past. It was actually a point -to-point swim. It started off with a long straightaway that went out into the middle of Lake Mead. And then once they got there, they turned around and swam back towards shore. And so it was kind of like a longer distance swim than normal. But again, it was still pretty warm water. But as soon as they hit shore, they were able to get right into transition and start getting out onto the bike.   As far as the bike goes, this year's course had some changes from last year. They added two new climbs. One was called Hogback Hill, which was about three miles from the finish line. And then another one was called Black Mountain Road, which was actually closer to transition. So those were both climbs that we hadn't seen before. And then after that, there was a nice downhill section where the riders could really open things up again. And then after that, it was more rolling hills until finally getting down to the finish line.  After the bike leg, the runners came through transition and headed off on the run portion of the race. This year's run course was a little bit longer than usual. It was about 1 .3 miles long instead of the standard 1 .1 mile loop. And so it took us through some residential areas as well as some commercial areas. And then eventually got us back over to the finish line.   Well, thanks for watching our video.

We're at Delaware University for the game between the Blue Hens and the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. Let's get into it. The Blue Hens came out of this one with a big win over Rutgers today by a final score of 13 -9. It was a great day to be a Blue Hen as they were able to get their first conference win of the season. They also got some good contributions from guys like Ryan Brown who had two goals and three assists. And then you have guys like Matt Eder who scored his first goal of the year. He did that off a nice pass from Ryan Brown. But overall, I think what stood out most about this game was how well Delaware played offensively. They really moved the ball around very well throughout the entire game. And when you do that, you create opportunities for yourself. You can see that Rutgers' defense kind of got caught flatfooted there a little bit. But overall, Delaware just looked really sharp today.

And he catches another nice brim. And again, you'll notice that the fish aren't really biting too hard. They're just taking the bait gently. They're not smashing them like they do during the winter months. But if you keep working the area, eventually you'll find that fish. Now, here's a little tip from Mark. He's going to show us how to land a brim. He's going to use the net as a landing mat. It's very important when you're handling fish that you don't want to damage their scales or their fins. So he's going to place him down gently onto the net. Then he's going to grab him under the jaw. That way he doesn't damage his gills. And then he's going to hold him upside down.

Again, we worked the clinch. We worked the pinching work. We worked the disarm. And then we finished it off by getting into a clinch, working pinching work, and finishing with a disarm. So you could take these drills and apply them to any type of stick training that you have. Again, this is just a basic idea. If you wanted to add some kicks, if you wanted to add some strikes, maybe even some grappling elements, go ahead and do it. This is where your creativity comes in. Don't feel like you need to stay within these boundaries. Just know that there's a lot of things that you can do with sticks. It's not limited just to striking. There's a lot of other ways that you can use it. Okay, so play around with it. Have fun. Be safe. Don't hurt each other too much. But yeah, play around with it. Have fun. Practice. Train hard.

The Dutchman fell heavily at the last fence, adding four faults to his earlier score. It meant the Netherlands' hopes of winning at home were over. Brazilian Ryding had been left with the task of keeping the Dutch at bay. He too struggled with the final fence, adding four faults to his score. That left Willem Greve to ride Zypria S. His horse looked in great form, but despite a faultless performance, the Dutch were unable to take advantage of the Brazilians' mistakes. A single time fault was added to his earlier score, meaning the Dutch would finish second behind Brazil.  Marc Houtsager had the chance to win it for the Netherlands and he did not let them down. With a clear jump off round, the Dutchman secured victory for his country.  Houtzager's win means that the Netherlands now have 12 points from six events this season.

I mean, it's not too bad. The only thing I would say is that sometimes when you load them, they don't always go in straight. So you kind of have to push them in. But once they're in, they work fine. They feed great. And yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty nice. One thing I noticed was that it does make the gun feel a lot heavier than normal. But other than that, the trigger feels great. The hopper feels great. Everything else seems to be working fine. Yeah, and also another thing too is that sometimes when you reload, if you get a jam or something, you'll notice that there's no way to clear jams unless you take off the whole adapter. So just keep that in mind. Other than that though, yeah, it's pretty cool. Definitely worth checking out.  All right, so now we're gonna talk about some pros and cons of using the MagFit Adapter. First off, some pros. First pro is that it's very lightweight. Second pro is that it's very easy to use. Third pro is that it's very reliable. Fourth pro is that it's very accurate.

So now let me show you guys how easy it is to get a shot out quickly and accurately using the hover system. So first off, we're going to start by getting our windage dialed in. We know where our zero is. We know where our target is. All we have to do is come up here, click on the app, click on the laser button, and it will tell us exactly where we need to dial. Now, when you look at the screen, you might say, oh my gosh, that's a lot of numbers. But don't worry because all you have to do is look at the bottom left -hand corner of the screen. You'll see the word solution. That's telling you exactly where you need to dial. So we're looking at minus 41 mils. All we have to do is dial minus 41 mils. Now, if you notice, there's no wind right now. But let's say there was wind. Let's say there was two mile per hour left crosswind. Well, all you would have to do is come back up here, press the wind button, and it will give you an additional number. So instead of being minus 41, it would be minus 41 plus two.

So again, you'll notice my feet are not even close together. They're spread apart. And I have all my weight on this back foot right now. My front foot is just barely touching the ground. It's almost like I'm standing on one toe. But as soon as I start moving, my body will shift forward onto both legs. Now, if I was shooting from here, it would be hard for me to move because I'd be too far forward. So what I need to do is I need to bring myself backwards by bending both knees. That way I can still shoot while I'm moving. So let's take a look at that.  Bend those knees. Move. Shoot.  All right? Again, bending those knees. Moving. Shooting.

Here I did three sets of five. Again, very light weights here. Just trying to get some good reps under the belt. The main thing I want to focus on today was keeping my elbows tucked in tight and getting full range of motion. That way when I do go back to heavier weights, I don't lose anything in terms of strength. Afterwards, I moved over to some incline presses. These were also pretty light as well. Three sets of eight. Again, just focusing on form here. Keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight. Getting a full stretch before pushing through. And then afterwards, moving on to some dumbbell flies. These were actually pretty heavy. I had two plates per side. Three sets of ten. And these felt great. They always feel great. Really helps build up that upper chest area.

So clusters means we're taking a set amount of reps and putting them together as a group. So today we're doing nine clusters. Each cluster will have three deadlifts and five squats. For the deadlift, you're going to start from the floor. Keep those elbows locked out throughout this whole movement. Squeeze the butt at the top. Then five squats. The first rep should be a clean. Pull the weight up to the shoulders. Second rep would be a push press. Third rep would be a clean again. Fourth rep would be another push press. Fifth rep would be a clean. Sixth rep would be a push press. Seven, eight, and nine would be squats. After you complete those nine clusters, then you're moving right into 11 strict pull -ups. If you don't have access to a barbell, the home gym variation is going to be double dumbbell clusters. Same thing. Three deadlifts followed by five squats. But instead of using that barbell, you're going to use two dumbbells. Once you've completed your nine clusters, then you're moving right into 11 strict pull -ups. Happy September 11th.

They're from Krasnodar, which is in Russia. And they were coached by Nina Zueva, who was also the coach of the Russian team at the Olympics. She has since left Russia and moved to Canada. And she is now working with the Canadian pair Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. So this is going to be interesting because we've seen some changes already with Tessa and Scott. We'll see what happens here as well. But I'm sure it will help them out tremendously.   Well, you know, they have been around for quite a while. They started out as juniors back in 1996. And then they went through two different coaches before finally landing on Nina Zueva. So this is not really new for them. But you can tell that they do have some chemistry together.

It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter what your record is. If you get a short notice fight, it's going to be tough. And when you get a short notice fight against someone as good as Wu Yannan, that's even more difficult. So let me tell you something right now. Jocelyn Edwards has been in some very tough fights. She fought Megan Anderson. She fought Raquel Pennington. She fought Roxanne Modarresi. All those women were very tough fighters. But they all had one thing in common. They were strikers. They weren't grappling fighters. So when you look at Jocelyn Edwards' record, she's 11 -4. That means she lost four times. Four times! Four times! Now, four losses isn't bad. That's not too many losses. But the reason why her loss percentage isn't higher than what it should be is because of how often she fights. Because if you think about it, how many times does Jocelyn Edwards fight per year? Does she fight twice a year? Does she fight three times a year? No, she fights five times a year. Five times a year. So even though she only has 11 wins, her win percentage is actually pretty high. Because she's fighting so often. Now, let's talk about the fight itself. The fight began with both women exchanging strikes. Both women exchanging strikes. Both women exchanging strikes. Both women exchange strikes. Both women exchanged strikes.

I guess the only thing better than riding his course is watching him ride his course. Because he does things on his bike that no other human being could possibly do.

So when you're attacking from the back, if you're not able to get the choke, and you feel like he's defending well, okay? So maybe it's better to go for something else. Maybe you should try to pass the guard, or maybe you should just go for some kind of submission, like a triangle, something like that. Okay? But sometimes we forget that the person has one arm free, so you could use that arm to attack. And usually people don't expect that. They focus only on the choke. They focus on the neck, and they forget that they still have one arm free. All right? So sometimes you need to be creative, especially when you're fighting someone good. If you fight someone bad, they'll probably give up the choke anyway. But if you fight somebody good, maybe you need to be creative. Maybe you need to find another way to finish them. All right? So let me show you guys one more thing. When you're fighting from butterfly guard, usually people smash your legs together. Right? So how do you defend against that? Let's say this guy wants to smash my legs together. He's trying to pass my guard. What am I supposed to do? Well, first of all, when somebody tries to pass your guard, you need to keep your legs straight. Because if you bend your knees, then he can easily pass your guard. So make sure to keep your knees straight. Now, what happens is that most of the times, when you're fighting butterfly guard, most of the times you're fighting with two grips. One hand here, one hand here. That's why it's important to keep your head close to your opponent. because if you put your head away over here, now he can grab my leg and start passing my leg. So always keep your head close to your opponent.  Also, make sure to control your opponent's head. If you don't control his head, he might grab your leg again and start passing your leg. So always control your opponent's head. Keep your head close to your opponent. Keep your knees straight. And now he's smashing my legs together. What am I supposed to do? Well, I'm gonna take my hand off. I'm gonna push him away. And now I'm gonna take my foot out. And now I'm gonna push myself forward...."}

It's going good. The main thing is to have a strong grip. If you can hold the barbell with your hands without any help from your legs or your hips, you're gonna be able to lift more weight. That's why I always recommend people to work on their grip. Also, if you want to get stronger, you should work on your grip. Because if you have weak grip, that means you're using too much energy for holding the barbell and less energy for lifting the barbell. So if you have stronger grip, you're gonna be able to use more energy for lifting the barbell. And also, you're gonna be able to lift heavier weights. That's what happened in my case.

Beautiful barrel by Seth Moniz. Just getting a little bit of airtime there. And then finishing off with a nice little hack. That's going to be a solid score. It's going to help him get back into the mix. We're going to see some big numbers coming through. The judges are really enjoying what they're seeing. They're giving them the benefit of the doubt. There's a lot of energy being thrown into each and every maneuver. Seth Moniz pulling in.   A little bit of a bumpy exit.  Not too worried about it though because he's got himself a nine eight three.  Let's have a look at this replay.  Seth Moniz on the outside.  Picks up a nice left hander.  Gets a nice exit.

And then we will do some performance analysis. So far, it seems like it's shooting pretty good. It's not too bad. It's not as fast as I would have liked to see it shoot. But we'll take a look at that later. But yeah, let me finish up this pod and then we can talk more about the gun. All right, so I finished up the first pod. And now we're filling up another one. We filled two pods before we started doing some performance testing. So we're going to be filling another pod here. And then we'll start talking about what we found during our testing. All right, so we're back from filling up three pods. Now we're filling up four. And we're going to start talking about what we found after all these tests. Alright, so we did four pods today. The first one was filled at 450 psi. The second one was filled at 425 psi. The third one was filled at 400 psi. And the fourth one was filled at 375 psi. So we were able to get a really nice range of results there. And we also had different types of paint. We used Dye T -Macs, T -Macs, and Dye Recon. So we tried different paints. We shot them through different pressures. And we got a lot of data today. So what we're going to do is we're going to break down all those numbers into average FPS per round. And then we're going to show you how many shots each pod held. And then we're going to tell you how much air capacity each pod has. So if you want to skip ahead to any part of the video, feel free to use those timestamps below. Otherwise, just keep watching until the end because we're going to wrap things up by telling you whether or not we recommend buying this gun. So without further ado, here's your average FPS per round. At 450 psi, we averaged around 280 FPS. At 425 psi, we averaged around 270 FPS. At 400 psi, we averaged around 260 FPS. And finally, at 375 psi, we averaged around 250 FPS. As you can see, the lower the PSI, the slower the gun shoots. That makes sense because you don't have enough energy behind the ball to make it go very fast. Also, the higher the PSI, the less shots per pod you get. For example, at 450 psi, our pods held an average of 120 balls. At 425 psi, they held an average of 115 balls. At 400 psi, they held an average of 110 balls. And at 375 psi, they held an average of 105 balls. So again, the lower the PSI, the fewer shots you get. However, the higher the PSI, the more shots you get. So if you want to maximize your shots per pod, then you should run this gun as high as possible. If you want to maximize your FPS, then you should run this gun as low as possible. In terms of air capacity, these pods hold between 1 .5 and 2 cubic feet of air. So depending on which pressure you choose, that's how much air you're going to get inside of your pod. So overall, if you're looking for a gun that's easy to maintain, has great trigger response, and doesn't require any tuning, then this might be the gun for you. However, there are some downsides to this gun. For example, the hopper isn't very big. It holds only 150 balls. So you're constantly having to refill it. Another downside is that the gun doesn't come with a tank mount. So if you plan on running compressed air, then you're going to need to buy one separately. Finally, the price point is kind of high. This gun costs $500. So if you're willing to spend that money, then you could probably buy yourself a better marker than this one. Overall, though, this gun performs well. It's accurate. It's reliable. And it's easy to maintain. If you're looking for something simple, something that requires little maintenance, and something that won't cost you a ton of money, then this might be the marker for you. However, if you're looking for something that's faster, something that's more powerful, or something that's cheaper, then maybe check out other options. Anyway, thanks for watching guys.

He finished clear and fast, ensuring the winning score of zero penalties. And as such, he secured the title for Brazil.

We're coming to you live from Kenan Stadium where Maryland defeated North Carolina today. The Terps jumped out to a quick lead early in the first quarter thanks to some great ball movement and some great shooting. They went up 4 -1 early in the first quarter. North Carolina wasn't able to respond until midway through the second quarter when they scored twice within a minute and a half. But Maryland responded again with another goal to go into halftime up 6 -3. In the third quarter, Connor Kelly had himself a big game. He scored three goals in the third quarter alone. He finished with five goals total. And he also added an assist as well. It was a very impressive performance by the senior midfielder.  Maryland won the game 15 -7.

We're here. From here, I'm pushing it towards his face. Grabbing his wrist. Pushing it away. That's where I can start striking. Alright, so there's another option for you to play with. It's pretty simple. Again, you can add in any type of technique that you want to do. But just remember, when you're training, be safe. Don't hurt each other. If you're using sticks, make sure they're soft enough that you won't hurt yourself or your partner. Also, if you're new to Krav Maga, or even if you're not, don't forget about the basics. The basics will always get you far. They're very important. And also, remember, this is a self -defense system. It's not meant to win championships. It's not meant to win fights. It's meant to keep you alive. Keep you safe. Get you home safely. Make sure you have a good life. All right, so always think about those things as you practice. Have fun. Be safe. Practice smart. Always wear your gear. Wear your helmet. Wear your gloves. Protect yourself. Protect others. And most importantly, enjoy it. Have fun. Be safe. Stay strong. Stay safe. And until next time, guys,..."}

In contrast, Solomon has been fighting for years, but this is his first time making it to the semi -finals. He'll look to make the most of his opportunity here tonight. Both fighters have a similar style, but there are some key differences that could play a role in this matchup. First off, both men are southpaws, which means they both throw their right hand as their lead hand. This can create problems when facing orthodox fighters because they're used to seeing right hands coming down the middle. However, if you've ever seen two lefties fight each other, you know how difficult it can be to land punches against them. So we should see plenty of action tonight. Another difference between these men is their height and reach. Santana stands at five foot ten inches tall with a 6 '1 inch reach while Solomon stands five feet eight inches tall with a six foot three inch reach. That gives Solomon an advantage in terms of reach which could help him get out of trouble or set up his offense. But Santana has shown he can close distance and land big shots so we shouldn't count him out just yet. Lastly, these guys have different styles when it comes to punching power. Santana has more knockout wins than Solomon does, but Solomon does have better knockout percentage. It seems like whenever Solomon gets hit, it hurts him enough to put him on the ropes where he can then land counter punches. And I think that's what we'll see tonight. I'm going to go ahead and take Brad Solomon to win this one via split decision. Let me know your thoughts down below. Who do you got? Who do you think will win between Santana and Solomon?

So if you don't know what these things are, here's one right here. So this is the gimbal. It's basically like a little stabilizer. You can put your GoPro on there and then when you're riding or whatever, it keeps everything nice and smooth. And then the other thing is called the max lens mod. And it does exactly what it says. It makes your camera lens bigger. So let me show you how both of them work. Then we'll go out and do a comparison between them. So first up is the gimbal. Now, I got this from Amazon. It was $30. There's tons of different ones online. They all pretty much work the same way. They're all battery powered. The only difference is some of them have buttons where you can turn off the stabilization and others don't. But essentially, you just plug your GoPro into one side, turn it on, and then when you start moving around, everything stays nice and smooth. So as long as you keep moving forward, everything should stay nice and stable. Now, if you stop, or if you move too fast, like if you hit a big jump or something, sometimes it doesn't quite catch up with you. But overall, it works pretty well. One downside though is that it adds a bit more weight to your helmet. Next up is the Max Lens Mod. Now, this is actually made by GoPro themselves. It costs about $50 Canadian. What it does is it basically takes the standard lens cover off your camera and replaces it with a larger one. That means you get a wider field of view. As far as the quality goes, there isn't any noticeable difference. However, because it's not actually a lens, but rather just a piece of plastic, it's less likely to get scratched than the actual lens itself. Also, since it's made by GoPro, it fits perfectly onto their cameras. If you use another brand, you might run into issues with fitment. Overall, I think it's worth getting if you plan on using your GoPro a lot. Alright guys, now let's head back down to the bottom and compare the two together.

So it's 4 -1. The Lancers are rolling. And then they score one more time. On a wild pitch. So it's 5 -1. And then McGill makes them pay for those wild pitches. With a base hit. And then Kayla Unvergatz comes through once more. She's been doing that all year long. And then Jenna Hernandez. Gets the job done as well. So it's 5 -3. We head to the fourth inning.

Well, we were there for the... Kentucky Derby trial and she ran against some really tough horses. She beat Majestic Warrior who later won the Kentucky Derby. She beat American Pharoah who later won the Triple Crown. She beat Frosted who later won the Belmont Stakes. So there was no doubt that this is a special filly. The next race after that was the Hollywood Derby. She beat American Pharaoh again and Frosted again. And so at that point, everyone knew that she was something special. Then she went on to win the Breeders' Cup Classic. And then she came back and won the Santa Anita Sprint Championship. And then she ended her career with another win in the Breeders' Cup Classic...."}

And we've done quite a few groups and tested several different types of bullets. But one thing that has really stood out to us is how well the Hornady round balls shoot. So if you'll notice, here's a grouping of five shots at 60 yards. That's a half inch grouping. Now, keep in mind, this is only at 60 yards. We haven't tried anything longer than that yet. But I'm sure they would still do very well. The other thing is... These are some bullets made by Randy Mitchell. He makes these for his customers. They're called Coyote Slugs. They're also very tight. As you can see, they're also about a half inch tight. Again, all of these were fired off of 3 ,600 PSI.  And then finally, what we did was we took three shots of the Hornady round ball.  And we measured them. And as you can see, it's pretty darn close. It's actually within one tenth of an inch. So if you want to know why you should use Hornady round balls, there you go. They're consistent. They're accurate.  And they work great in your Corsair. All right, thanks for watching.

Eric Jones wins the Coke Zero Sugar 400. And he becomes the youngest winner in NASCAR history. He was just 22 years old when he won this race. That's right. And that's what we're talking about. We were talking about how young these guys are getting into the sport. They've got some great talent. But they have to be able to get their chances. They need to get their opportunities. And Eric Jones has done that. He's been very good for Joe Gibbs Racing. And now he gets his first win. Well, you see Martin Truex Jr., who had such a great run tonight, he's not even close enough..."}

And here comes Elyse Hoffner Hibbs from Colorado Springs, Colorado. She has been a member of the U .S. national team for three years now. She won the all -around title at last year's World Championships. But this is her first time back on these apparatus since that injury last summer. So we'll see how comfortable she feels with them.   Well, you know, it's interesting when you look at the list of gymnasts who've been injured over the past few months, but they're not all coming back right away. They're taking their time. They want to make sure everything's right before they get out there. That's what I like about this event. It gives you plenty of time to work through your issues. And if you can't get it together by the end of August, then... you might as well just take some time off and come back next..."}

They don't want to lose their serve. They did not win their serve yet today. So it's a big point coming up here.  Serving for the first time today.  Nice play from Braun.  She's been doing well in these situations.   It's a good return...."}
